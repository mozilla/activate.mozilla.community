          <p>We encourage you to run these as lean as possible, but realise that sometimes there can be some costs incurred for logistics or refreshments. If your event meets the requirements laid out in the activity, there is a fund available of up to $150 USD per event. This can be used for only the following items/services:</p>
        </Localized>
        <ul>
          <Localized id="faq-budget-answer-2">
            <li>Locally produced stickers and/or other small items (only for an event for over 50 people)</li>

        <Localized id="faq-budget-answer-7">
          <p>To make the request, you will need to make a Reps budget request. If you are not a Rep, please contact a local Rep to help you. We will fast-track valid requests, which are ones that meet the requirements of the activity. For larger budget requests, it will be processed like any other Reps budget request and there is no guarantee it will be approved and even if so, whether it will be on time.</p>
