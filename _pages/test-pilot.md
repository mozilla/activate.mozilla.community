## Impact and Metrics

Firefox is key to how Mozilla expresses its values and makes the Web increasingly exciting in the face of walled gardens like individual apps. By testing new features and functionality, you help to keep Firefox on the leading edge and consumers engaged in our product. Additionally, it gives you a chance to go even deeper with specific feedback and ideas for Firefox.

### Goals for this area

__Impact:__

* 500 Test Pilot add-on installs

__Strength:__

* 300 shares of Test Pilot link from the activity page
* 50 Discourse Posts

## Audience for this activity

The audience this activity is anyone who is passionate about the Web and knows their way a little around Web browsers. No programming skills are necessary. It is for people who like to try new things and are not shy in telling us what they think.

This activity is retired. What this means is that we don't recommend that you run the activity at this time and resources will no longer be available.

When building features for hundreds of millions of Firefox users worldwide, it’s important to get them right. To help figure out which features should ship and how they should work, we created the new Test Pilot program. Test Pilot is a way for you to try out experimental features and let us know what you think. You can turn them on and off at any time, and you’ll always know what information you’re sharing to help us understand how these features are used. Of course, you can also use Test Pilot to provide feedback and suggestions to the teams behind each new feature.

## Activity Format

While this activity can be run solo, we encourage you to run an event in your community to get together people to learn about testing experimental Firefox features and discuss what is upcoming in the browser. We recommend a smaller, more informal event, such as a MozCoffee.

## Event Flow

* [Install Test Pilot](http://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments?utm_source=activity.mozilla.community%26utm_medium=referral%26utm_campaign=moz-community-2016)
* Enable and test features
* Provide feedback via the add-on
* Start a discussion on [Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/test-pilot)

## Output

Additional to the recommended flow here are some things we’d like you, the event organizer, to do.

* Fill out the post-event metrics on the event page you setup on the Reps portal
* Tell us about how you got on. What was your favourite new browser feature?
    * [Test Pilot Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/test-pilot)
    * [Feedback about the activity specifically](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/activate-mozilla-install-test-pilot/10075/1)
