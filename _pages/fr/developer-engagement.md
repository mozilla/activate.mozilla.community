Developers are very important for Mozilla. Everything we do is not only to serve our hundreds of millions of users, but to bring Mozilla's manifesto and values to web developers and make their lives easier. We provide many things for developers. To name just a few, we have first class developer tools in Firefox, a world leader add-ons platform, and widely recognised developer documentation portal in MDN.

Because of this, we always aim to work more with developers to hear what their needs are and to bring our stories to them. This is where you come in. These activities are about working with developers and telling them about the latest and greatest that is happening with Mozilla and around the Web.

Our current activities in this area are:

* [Dive Into Rust]({{ "rust-hack" | prepend: page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* [Web Compatibility Sprint]({{ "webcompat-sprint" | prepend: page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }})
