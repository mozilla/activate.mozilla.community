Having more developers and content creators playing with WebVR is important for the future of virtual reality to help build towards a free and open virtual reality platform not owned by any individual entity.

[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences, making it easy for anyone to get involved with virtual reality. Its goal is to onboard developers into 3D and advance WebVR, an open platform for virtual reality that leverages the Web. __Having more developers and content creators playing with WebVR is important for the future of virtual reality to help build towards a free and open virtual reality platform not owned by any individual entity__.

A-Frame is used extensively by the Mozilla VR team to prototype and experiment with WebVR. __Having more contributors know A-Frame will give them a chance to get involved in one of the most exciting revolutions in the field of technology__.

## Impact and Metrics

### Goals for this area

__Impact:__

* 200 people signed up to the [A-Frame Slack channel](https://aframe.io/community/#a-frame)
* 100 projects built in or for A-Frame
* 20 blog posts about events, activities, experiences, projects, or tutorials.
* 500 social shares with #MozActivate, #WebVRCamp, @aframevr, @mozillavr

__Strength:__

* 20 Mobilizers activated
* 30 events
* 400 people are introduced to and starting to build with A-Frame

## Audience for this activity

Your audience for this event should be anyone interested in virtual reality including web developers, designers and students. The audience should have a basic grasp of HTML.

## Activity Format

Help us build community around the A-Frame library by conducting a mobilizing / learning event for 20-30 contributors.

### 2-4 Weeks Before the Event

1. Put an event team together
2. Choose a date and secure a venue
3. Setup the event on Reps Portal ([instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Event_hosting)). [Find a Rep](https://reps.mozilla.org/people/) closeby to do this if you are not one.
4. Give a thought whether it will be self-facilitated or with someone who has A-Frame experience. You can find help on the [Mozilla VR Telegram group](https://telegram.me/MozillaVR) or the [A-Frame Slack channel](https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/)
5. Create an event page on a platform popular in your locale, such as Facebook or Meetup.com, and keep posting interesting information about WebVR & related topics to keep continue the conversation
6. Download and customize the [A-Frame Presentation Kit](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-presentation-kit)
7. Create a few scenes for demo & prototyping purposes. You can find examples on [awesome-aframe](https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe)
8. Acquire headsets to use and demo. Google Cardboard can be acquired in some locations for less than $5 a set. We recommend 5 headsets for an event of 20-30 people. You can request budget of up to $50 maximum for these headsets but you will have to buy them yourself.

### 1 Week Before the Event

1. Confirmed selected attendees through email.
2. Distribute the following list of tasks to do before event:
    1. Create a GitHub account if they don’t have one
    2. Get familiar with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and [read about areas to contribute](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    3. Join the [A-Frame Slack Channel](https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/)
    4. [Optional] Play with A-Frame, starting with a [Hello World scene](https://codepen.io/mozvr/pen/BjygdO). Skim through the [documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/introduction/getting-started.html).

## Event Flow

This is how you can break up a 4 hour event format. You can try to shorten some sections if you want to do it quicker.

### Getting Started (30 minutes)

* Introduction of speakers and attendees with an ice breaker session (e.g., [catch the ball](http://businessmajors.about.com/od/icebreakers/a/Icebreaker8.htm))
* About [Mozilla’s mission](https://www.mozilla.org/mission/) as a non-profit and community-focused organization.
* About [VR, WebVR & A-Frame](https://gurumukhi.wordpress.com/2016/09/21/a-frame-for-vr-development-on-web/)
* Quickly note social tags: #MozActivate, #WebVRCamp, @mozillavr

### A-Frame [Concepts](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/introduction/) (30 minutes)

* [Demo](http://aframe.io/examples) of basic A-Frame scenes & apps. More examples at [A Week of A-Frame](https://aframe.io/blog/)
* Show off [A-Painter](https://blog.mozvr.com/a-painter/)
* Introduce HTML tags. If audience is more technical, also introduce the [entity-component-system pattern](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/introduction/#entity-component-system)

### Time to Hack (1 hour)

* Propose your idea of VR experiences to build
* Can get started with [Codepen](http://codepen.io/mozvr/pen/BjygdO) or the [Boilerplate](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate)
    * For the boilerplate, we recommend using a local server such as [Mongoose](https://www.cesanta.com/products/binary) or through Node.js.

### More About A-Frame (30 minutes)

* A-Frame in depth (e.g., demo of advanced scenes, how are they built, using community components)

### Continue Hacking (1 hour)

* Improve your VR experience or build something else using more advanced concepts

### Review & Plan (30 minutes)

* Review the whole event
* Talk about [A-Frame community](http://aframe.io/community/). Don’t forget to mention if you have a separate communication medium to connect with the local WebVR community (e.g., WebVR-India telegram group)
* Discuss takeaways
* Discuss individual action plans and follow-up plans

## Output
