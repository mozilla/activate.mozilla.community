## Activities

These activities were designed with 2 things in mind:

1. That they have the potential to have a direct impact on Mozilla’s work right now
2. That they bring value to you and your community. While we have specific metrics for each activity, one of the main overall goals is that we all get better at mobilising and building communities.

Before you jump right in: Look at your goals for the year, what do you and your community want to accomplish in each of the impact areas? Which of the following activities best map to those goal? And very importantly, ask yourself if by doing these activities you can expose new people to the work that Mozilla is doing and we can build new communities around them.

**Web Compatibility Sprint**
Web Compatibility, the ability for all Web content to run in all browsers, is important. There are multiple web content engines running on multiple devices, and sometimes with a little testing and some small tweaks to their site, developers can ensure that more users can have the full experience that is desired. Test sites and spread the message about compatibility.
