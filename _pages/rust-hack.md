## Impact and Metrics

The Rust programming language will be important to the future of the web, making it safe and great. Having more developers understand, use and evangelize this language will advance make the web better and more secure.

Rust will also be used extensively for Mozilla projects -- including this year as Servo (written in Rust) is advanced even further, and parts of it are moved into Gecko/Firefox. Having more Mozilla contributors know Rust will give them a chance to contribute to the most exciting and important technical projects coming up for Mozilla.

### Goals for this area

__Impact:__

* 1,000 programmers/developers are introduced to and are well on their way to learning Rust
* 10 blog posts about events or other local Rust activities

__Strength:__

* 50 Mozillians organize Rust Hack and Learn events
* 50 new people signed up to [Rust developer list](https://users.rust-lang.org)

## Audience for this activity

Your audience for this event should be **programmers and developers**. Focus on people who are technical and already know languages like C or Python or other similar languages.

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. [Find out more...](https://www.rust-lang.org)

## Activity Format

Get your community behind this exciting new programming language by running a learning event.

1. Put an event team together
2. Choose a date and secure a venue
3. Choose whether this will be self-facilitated or with someone who has Rust experience (see below)
4. Setup the event on Reps Portal ([instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Event_hosting)). Please make sure the initiative is set to "MozActivate" and the functional area indicates "Rust".

For duration, we recommend a half-day (or full evening) event with a minimum of 15-25 attendees.

There are two options for facilitation:

1. Ask a person with experience with Rust to attend and provide guidance to attendees. There are a few ways to try to find local Rust experts to invite:
    * Reach out to the [Community Team](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html#Community-team) - community-team [at] rust-lang [dot] org - they know the most active people in most regions.
    * Via the [user groups](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/user-groups.html)
    * At [rustaceans.org](http://www.rustaceans.org/)
2. If the facilitators have little or no Rust experience, turn it into a learning session for everyone, where you go through the steps together. Some Mozillians have already done such sessions. For example our [Community Spaces](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation/Community_Spaces) have, so you can reach out the them to ask for some guidance.

## Event Flow

* Install Rust
    * [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs) - recommended
    * [Rust downloads](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html) (alternative)
* Read the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
* Complete the [Rustlings](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings) (a great beginners course!)
* Some projects with great first bugs:
    * The Rust language and compiler
        * [Labeled easy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy)
        * [Labeled mentor](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-mentor)
    * [clippy - the popular Rust static analysis tool](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy)
    * [Cargo - Rust’s package manager](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy)
    * [rustfmt - the Rust source code formatting tool](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues)
        * Though some are without clear instructions, the domain is easy to understand (it's mostly manipulating strings), and potentially engaging.
    * [rustup - the Rust installer](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
    * Rust documentation
        * [Labeled easy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-docs+label%3AE-easy)
        * [Standard library API docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
    * [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) also publishes a call for participation each week with hot contribution ideas.

## Directly at the end of the activity
Immediately after the event don’t forget to share the link to the impact form with your attendees:

{: .attention-link}
[mzl.la/howwasit](http://mzl.la/howwasit)

Remember this is how you’ll know who attended your event, and if you successfully inspired them to action! We recommend adding it to your final slide AND emailing it out after the event.

## Other Resources

### Tutorials

* [Niko Matsakis's excellent slide deck](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorials-keynote)
* [Exercises to accompany that deck](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorializer)
* [A screencast from Niko on ownership and borrowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCUBSbJENO4)

## Output
Additional to the recommended event flow here are some things we’d like you, the event organizer, to do.

* Fill out the post-event metrics on the event page you setup on the Reps portal
* Optionally, tell us about your event. This can be before or after. We love to hear about upcoming plans, and of course love to hear about what was achieved at the event with a picture or two! This will also be instructional and inspirational to others who might do the event.
    * [Here is the Discourse post to write to](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/activate-mozilla-dive-into-rust/10073/1)

## Extra
While the focus of this activity should be on these events, there are other ways to stay more involved with the Rust community after.

* Follow up with attendees to highlight [more things happening in the community to get involved with](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/community.html)
