Web Compatibility, the ability for all Web content to run in all browsers, is important. There are multiple web content engines running on multiple devices, and sometimes with a little testing and some small tweaks to their site, developers can ensure that more users can have the full experience that is desired.

For more background and data on Web Compatibility, read the [recent blog post on Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/07/make-the-web-work-for-everyone/)

## Impact and Metrics

At Mozilla, we want the web running well for everyone, not just in one or two browsers. This means cross-browser, and cross-device. Our global community can give visibility to this that no team could ever match!

### Goals for this area

__Impact:__

* 300 Add-on installs
* 200 compatibility issues filed

__Strength:__

* 50 Mozillians run events
* 50 signups to the [compatibility list](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/forums/#compatibility)

## Audience for this activity

The audience this activity is anyone who is passionate on the topic, but being somewhat Web tech savvy is a help. No programming skills are necessary. It is for people who care about diversity on the Web.

## Activity Format

While this activity can be run solo, we encourage you to run an event in your community to get together people who care about the Web. The goal is to test sites, diagnose problems, and discuss how to evangelise locally to developers about a Web that works for everyone.

1. Put an event team together
2. Choose a date and secure a venue
3. Setup the event on Reps Portal ([instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Event_hosting))

For duration, we recommend a half-day (or full evening) event with a minimum of 10-15 attendees.

## Event Flow

* Set yourself up with Firefox. Any or all of the following versions:
    * [Firefox Beta 49+](https://www.mozilla.org//firefox/channel/)
    * [Firefox for Android Beta 49+](https://www.mozilla.org//firefox/channel/)
    * [Firefox for iOS](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/ios/)
* [Install the Webcompat.com Reporter add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/webcompatcom-reporter/)
    * We have a mobile add-on people can install for Fennec Beta and in version 50 there will be a default "Report Site Issue" menu item in Fennec Aurora and Nightly.
    * No add-ons support for iOS, but people can report bugs manually at [webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com)
* Choose the sites you want to test
    * We recommend the [Alexa Top 500](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) sites - either globally or by country
* Test and Report!
    * [Read the general guide](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Guide)
    * Pay special attention to what we are looking for [in reported issues](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Guide#Reporting_a_Web_compatibility_issue)
    * If you encounter something on the site not looking properly, or working correctly, then click the add-on button and follow the steps to report

## Output
Additional to the recommended event flow here are some things we’d like you, the event organizer, to do.

* Fill out the post-event metrics on the event page you setup on the Reps portal
* Optionally, tell us about your event. This can be before or after. We love to hear about upcoming plans, and of course love to hear about what was achieved at the event with a picture or two!
    * [Here is the Discourse post to write to](* https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/activate-mozilla-web-compatibility-sprint/10074/1)
* Encourage attendees who want to continue to work on Web Compat to sign up to the [mailing list](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/forums/#compatibility)

## Extra
While the focus of this activity should be on testing sprints, there are other ways to stay more involved with the community after.

* Bug diagnosis: This is about trying to understand the underlying issues behind bug reports, and where possible, providing suggested fixes for site owners. [More information](https://github.com/mozilla/participation-org/issues/237#issuecomment-163632626)
* Site outreach: This is about trying to get in contact with websites that have issues and (politely!) providing ways that they can improve compatibility or fix their bugs. [More information](https://github.com/mozilla/participation-org/issues/237#issuecomment-163632354)
