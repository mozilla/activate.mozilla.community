## Impact and Metrics

This activity has great potential to make an impact by increasing overall involvement in Nightly, simply by introducing community to tasks that they can engage in related to Nightly. Finding and filing issues early in the cycle means by the time Firefox gets to release, the code is in good shape.

### Campaign Goals

__Impact:__

* 500 Nightly installs
* 50 Bugzilla IDs actively filing bugs (or participating in Bugzilla)
* 50 Mozillians run events
* 100 new followers to Nightly Twitter account

## Audience
Your audience for this activity are people that are comfortable using the different features of Firefox and would like to dive a little deeper.  Maybe they want to learn some useful core skills that will help them as Mozillians or perhaps are comfortable using Developer Edition and want to learn more about Nightly. As just using Nightly gives us important information such as crashes, this is not only for developers or technical persons.

This activity has great potential to make an impact by increasing overall involvement in Nightly, simply by introducing community to tasks that they can engage in related to Nightly. Finding and filing issues early in the cycle means by the time Firefox gets to release, the code is in good shape.

Every day, Mozilla developers write code that is merged into a common code repository (mozilla-central) and every day that code is compiled so as to create a pre-release version of Firefox based on this code for testing purposes - this is what we call a Nightly build. Once this code matures, it is merged into stabilization repositories (Beta) where that code will be polished until we reach a level of quality that allows us to ship a new final release version of Firefox to hundreds of millions of people. This development process used to ship a new version of Firefox every 5 to 8 weeks is called the Train Model.

## Event Flow

While this activity can be run solo, we encourage you to run an event in your community.

__2-4 Weeks Before the Event__

1. Read the [Event Guide](/pt-BR/eventguide/) which helps you to organize the activity
2. Copy and adapt the [Introduction to Nightly slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dnl5jShMYDO-f_SDGM3yRr3Ac3XRF4XCZqlVwGcYm34/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Give a thought whether it will be self-facilitated or with someone who has Nightly experience. You can find help on the Mozilla Nightly Testers Telegram group or the irc.mozilla.org Nightly channel.
4. Create an event page on a platform popular in your locale, such as Facebook or Meetup.com, and keep posting interesting information about Nightly & related topics to keep continue the conversation on Twitter.

__TIP:__
In case you expect bandwidth issues  you can download copies of [Nightly for every platform](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/nightly/all/) as well as [Android builds](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/android/) to an USB stick in case you don’t have enough bandwidth for downloads at the event.

__Duration:__ For duration, we recommend 1-3 hours with at least 5 attendees.

__1 Week Before the Event__

1. Confirmed selected attendees through email
2. Distribute the following list of tasks to do before event:
  * Tell the audience to bring laptops and all mobile devices to the event
  * Check bugzilla credentials for organizers (if needed, ask for edit bugs/can confirm permissions)

__During the event__

1. Briefly introduce Nightly channel and why it is important to use in your locale using your slide deck
2. Get people to install Nightly on their devices
  * Explain telemetry
3. According to your audience background
  * Explain how to [file Nightly bugs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines)
  * Explain how to install [mozregression](https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/)
  * Explain how to triage or test bugs
4. Encourage participants to keep using Nightly


## Directly at the end of the activity
Immediately after the event don’t forget to share the link to the impact form with your attendees:

{: .attention-link}
[mzl.la/howwasit](http://mzl.la/howwasit)

Remember this is how you’ll know who attended your event, and if you successfully inspired them to action! We recommend adding it to your final slide AND emailing it out after the event.

## Output

Additional to the recommended event flow here are some things we’d like you, the event organizer, to do.

* Fill out the post-event metrics on the event page you set-up on the Reps portal
* Tell us about your event. We love to hear about upcoming plans, and of course love to hear about what was achieved at the event with a picture or two! This will also be instructional and inspirational to others who might do the event. [Here is the Discourse post to write to](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/a-new-nightly-activity/16746).
* Send an email to all participants with a summary and ask them to fill out the survey.
* Encourage attendees who want to continue to work on Nightly to sign up to the [Discourse category](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/nightly).

If your session was a success, there are two other Activities that require pre-release builds, how about running one of those as well?
