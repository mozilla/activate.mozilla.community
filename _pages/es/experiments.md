The Web doesn’t stand still, and in that spirit at Mozilla we are always trying new things. That could be everything from introducing new technologies like WebVR, to writing add-ons that showcase new ways to interact with the browser.

We’d like to showcase different things here to enable you to join in the experiment lifecycle -- build, test, and iterate. Initially however, the asks of the activities will be focused on testing new features in Firefox. The more usage we have, coupled with broad diversity of feedback, will enable us to better serve our hundreds of millions of users worldwide.

Our current activities in this area are:

* [e10s and Featured Add-ons]({{ "e10s-addons/" | prepend: page.url }})
* [Install and give feedback on Test Pilot]({{ "test-pilot/" | prepend: page.url }})
