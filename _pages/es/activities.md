## Actividades

Estas actividades se diseñaron teniendo en cuenta 2 cosas:

1. Que tienen el potencial suficiente como para tener un impacto directo en el trabajo de Mozilla ahora mismo
2. Que te dan un valor añadido a ti y a tu comunidad. While we have specific metrics for each activity, one of the main overall goals is that we all get better at mobilising and building communities.

Before you jump right in: Look at your goals for the year, what do you and your community want to accomplish in each of the impact areas? Which of the following activities best map to those goal? And very importantly, ask yourself if by doing these activities you can expose new people to the work that Mozilla is doing and we can build new communities around them.
